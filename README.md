Hackathons are awesome - but it's hard to find a high quality directory of events for high schoolers. That's where this project comes in.

**Goal:** create the best curated directory of hackathons for high school students. Because quite frankly hackathons shouldn't only be for university students.

### A word of warning...

To ensure that the directory remains as high quality as possible, we have strict guidelines for listing hackathons.

For the time being, primarily for ease of development, requests for listing new events happens through [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScytGFj0IBP3NSO1ZOKIwNaRLVF8tTpX8zis7_uE00-XLB29Q/viewform).

Please do not open an issue or submit a pull request to add your event - the form is the easiest and fastest way for us to review submissions.
